# Welcome to Sukhyun Kim's GitHub Page! 

Hello, this is Sukhyun Kim. 

I am passionate about solving business problems, and I become excited when I get to turn data into meaningful information. 

I have studied in information systems and digital marketing in college. And, I'm currently in a data analytics bootcamp to widen my horizon. 

You can find some of my school works and technical projects here.
